// <!-- You want to withdraw some money from your bank account.

// The program takes two numbers as input, your account balance and the amount you want to withdraw, and assigns them to corresponding "balance" and "withdraw" variables.

// Task
// Calculate and output the remaining balance after the withdrawal.

// Sample Input
// 450000
// 9000

// Sample Output
// 441000

// Explanation
// The first two lines of the given code declare the balance and the withdraw variables, whose values will be automatically taken as input and will be used in test cases. This means that your solution will be tested with different values of those variables.
// Don't change that part of the code and treat it as a usual variable. -->



let balance = parseInt(readLine(), 10);
let withdraw = parseInt(readLine(), 10);

//your code goes here
balance -= withdraw;
console.log(balance);
